    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p1>
    Thank you soliciting this badass website created by a team 
    of five dazed and confused college students.  Our operation 
    is stationed at San Diego State University's fantastic College of Engineering.
    All of us are majoring in Computer Engineering and we hope, for the sake
    of ourselves and others, that our sanity remains intact until graduation.
    That said, I hope you enjoy your time at Burning Rubber as much as we have enjoyed 
    creating it for you.

    <h2>Not Your Typical Dealership</h2>
    <p2>
    I'm sure you're well aware that there is an over abundance 
    of motorcycle and car dealerships across the internet.
